# Rock, Paper, Scissors

### (Dolphin, Unicorn)

Have you ever found your mind drifting while trying to get work done on your computer? In this short, whimsical version of Rock, Paper, Scissors (Dolphin, Unicorn), allow yourself a couple moments to drift away into game land and play, before re-setting and returning to the task at hand. Save this simple game to your desktop when you need a fun mental break!

In this project, we were asked to build an app that positions the human against the computer in a _classic_ and _advanced_ version of the game Rock Paper, Scissors. The rules to both games are located on the main page, which the user may reference at any time during play. In the classic game, users select a diamond ring (rock), paper airplane (paper), or pair of scissors and play as normal. In the _advanced_ game, a dolphin and unicorn are added.

## Local Set-Up Instructions

- From the repo click the code button and copy the SSH link.
- Open terminal by pressing command + space bar, and search for terminal
- Inside of you terminal type `git clone` and then paste the ssh link. It should look like this: [git@github.com:jordan-sullivan/Rock-Paper-Scissors.git](https://github.com/jordan-sullivan/Rock-Paper-Scissors)
- In your terminal type `cd rock-paper-scissors`
- Then type `open index.html`
- The browser should then deploy

## Instructions for Use

- On opening the browser, choose the version of the game you'd like to play.
- In the _CLASSIC GAME_, you will take a turn first, and select an icon.
- Immediatley after, the computer will select a randomly generated icon.
- Your choices, along with the winner result will be displayed on the page, and your scores will update in the side-bars.
- When there is a tie game, no one scores.
- Play as any times as you wish.
- In the _ADVANVED GAME_, the rules are the same.
- Refer to the main page button for rules on which icon beats another at any time.
- Choose a different game at any time and keep your current score intact.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

## Code Architecture

This project features:

- The index.html file defines the structure of the content and semanitcs of the page.
- A game.js and player.js file which stores most of the functionality for game on the data model.
- The main.js file provides the functionality for the page in connection to the DOM.
- The styles.css file houses the style choices for the application.

## Future Features

- Using _tool tips_ , I will add a hover event over the icons during game play to remind the user of the icon hierarchy
- A local storage feature will be implemented to save scores after page load
- A reset score button will be added to clear the score to 0

## Project management

- I used a [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xMrN91yreKphEQNtqLxi_6A7GXzYpAHfBB5SeMVoJE0/edit#gid=0) to help me stay on track and meet the deadline.
